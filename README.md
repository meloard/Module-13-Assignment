Module 13 Assignment - MYSQL - Backend 


# E-Commerce Back-End Server

## Description

In this project we were tasked with building the back-end framework and structure for an e-commerce project. This included many layers of documentation, including things like the server.js, connections, models, routes, and the seeds for testing. This gave a good overview of the necessary steps and technologies you need to get a server running, and able to make get/post/delete calls in insomnia. We again used dependencies such as MYSQL2 and express to handle this process.
